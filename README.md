Using SQL, Pewlett Hackard employees from the 1980s and 1990s were identified from six CSV files.

## Data Modeling
The CSV files were inspected and an Entity Relationship Diagram was made to show the relationship between the tables. The QuickDBD tool was used.

## Data Engineering  
Table schemas were made for each of the six tables with the proper contraints, importing the data from the CSV files.


## Data Analysis
Lists were generated identifying various information about the employees.
